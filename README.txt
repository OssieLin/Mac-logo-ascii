These are shell scripts that display an ASCII art welcome message for SSH remote login on Mac OS X.
It is a nice color image of the classic Apple logo along with ASCII text art for each version. It
can be placed in any directory as long as it's added to the path. The script can be called by
including the sh command followed by the filename within /etc/profile. Other OS X versions will
be added as I edit them.
