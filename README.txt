This is a shell script that displays an ASCII art
welcome message for SSH remote login on Mac OS X.
I have included scripts with the art for both
Mountain Lion and Snow Leopard. It is a nice color
image of the classic Apple logo along with ASCII
text art for each version. It can be placed in any
directory as long as it's added to the path. The
script can be called by including the sh command
and filename within /etc/profile. Other OS X
versions will be added if there is any interest.
