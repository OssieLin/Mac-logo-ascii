These are shell scripts that display an ASCII art welcome message for SSH remote login on Mac OS X.
It is a nice color image of the classic Apple logo along with ASCII text art for each version. It
can be placed in any directory as long as it's added to the path.\n
If the script is located at user/dev/shell, then it can be called by
entering the following command in terminal:
```cd dev/shell``` to enter the directory where the shell is
```sh  mac_OS_sequoia.sh``` to run the .sh file, which shows the logo.

```
cd dev/shell 
```

```
sh  mac_OS_sequoia.sh
```

I've included screenshots of the different versions just to be able to get a peek at how it looks.
