This is a shell script that displays an ASCII art
welcome message for SSH remote login on Mac OS X
Mountain Lion. It can be placed in any directory
as long as it's added to the path. The script
can be called by adding the sh command and filename
to /etc/profile. Other OS X versions will be added
if there is any interest.
